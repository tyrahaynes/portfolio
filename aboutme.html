    <body1> 6/27/2017 
      Python and Scratch are similar to each other. You dont have much guidence on Python like Scratch. Making a loop on python is similar to creating a loop on scratch. Today debugging my program was difficult it was a new experience for me, it was very challenging but i got through it. I like that i had to figure it out and work through all of those difficulties. I also have guidence from my peers around me.</body1>
